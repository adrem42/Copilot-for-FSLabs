Starting with this version, Copilot isn't running inside FSUIPC anymore. The reason for that is that the FSUIPC Lua environment
doesn't allow proper importing of dll Lua modules. The way I was integrating my dll isn't how it should be done and I've recently learned that it may, very rarely, cause the sim to crash (I apologize if it ever happened to you).
Please read the supplied README.txt for instructions on how to migrate from a previous version.

CHANGELOG:

Copilot:

 * Added PM_clears_scratchpad ini option

FSL2Lua:

 * You can create a script for keyboard and joystick bindings that will run in a separate thread from Copilot (see the manual).
