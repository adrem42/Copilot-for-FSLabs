Starting with this version, Copilot isn't running inside FSUIPC anymore. The FSUIPC Lua environment doesn't allow to import dll modules the proper wayand the way I was integrating my dll isn't how it should be done and may cause the sim to crash (I only learned this recently and I apologize if it ever happened to you).
Please read the supplied README.txt for instructions on how to migrate from a previous version.

CHANGELOG:

 * Added PM_clears_scratchpad ini option

 * The interface can be used to make voice commands for non-FSL aircraft

 * You can create a script for keyboard and joystick bindings that will run in a separate thread from Copilot (see the manual).
