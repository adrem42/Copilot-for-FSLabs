# Using the keyboard and joystick binding facilities

Copilot comes with a Lua interface for binding keyboard keys, joystick buttons and axes to FSLabs cockpit controls (or just Lua functions).

You don't need any coding experience - the syntax is very straightforward.

**Here's how to make the bindings:**

1. Create the file *Copilot for FSLabs\scripts\autorun.lua*

2. Write the code using the @{autorun.lua|example} and the video below as reference.

The script will auto-run when you load a flight. You can restart it manually via the FSL2Lua Add-ons submenu.
