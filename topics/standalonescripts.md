# Using the keyboard and joystick binding facilities

Copilot comes with Lua functions for binding keyboard keys, joystick buttons and axes to FSLabs cockpit controls (or any Lua function).

The syntax is straightforward enough that you don't need any programming experience. 

1. Create the file *Copilot for FSLabs\scripts\autorun.lua*

2. Define the bindings using the @{autorun.lua|example} and the video below as reference.

The script will auto-run when you load a flight. You can restart it manually via the FSL2Lua Add-ons submenu.
